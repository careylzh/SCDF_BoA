# Breathing Observation Apparatus(BoA), IoT-powered oxygen tank monitor for fire rescue operations
SCDF Lifesavers' Innovation Challenge 2018, 1st Runner-Up

Inspired by Adamâ€™s personal experience during his first firefighting experience when he ran out of air in the first 15mins of operation. Thankfully, it was a small fire in a HDB flat and he managed to escape. After some reflection and discussion with the team, he thought to himself if he could do something about it to prevent other fire personnel from falling into the same risky situation as he did. 

Use of data-analytics to better train and prepare fire personnel in air management during operations.
