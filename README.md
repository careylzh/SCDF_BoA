The project was inspired by Adamâ€™s personal experience during his first firefighting experience, in which he almost placed himself in danger when he ran out of air in the first 15mins of operation. Thankfully, it was a small fire in a HDB flat and he managed to escape. <br/> After some reflection and discussion with the team, he thought to himself if he could do something about it to prevent other fire personnel from falling into the same plight as he did. <br/> Despite the fact that there are no fatalities due to air mismanagement during operation in Singapore, we believe in data-driven analysis to better train and prepare fire personnel in air management during operations.
