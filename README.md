# Breathing Observation Apparatus(BoA), IoT-powered oxygen tank monitor for fire rescue operations
SCDF Lifesavers' Innovation Challenge 2018, 1st Runner-Up

Inspired by Adamâ€™s personal experience during his first firefighting experience when he ran out of air in the first 15mins of operation. Thankfully, it was a small fire in a HDB flat and he managed to escape. After some reflection and discussion with the team, he thought to himself if he could do something about it to prevent other fire personnel from falling into the same risky situation as he did.
Use of data-analytics to better train and prepare fire personnel in air management during operations.

Bluetooth was eventually selected over the other 2 because its operation range of about 30metres corresponded perfectly to the operation needs of fire rescuing. While WIFI and Cellular Data were good, our cost benefit analysis showed that bluetooth had the best price-range ratio, despite Cellular Data being the most reliable signal source. Other considerations such as the dependability of signals in physically dense environments were also considered as firerescuing is performed in particle-dense environments(potentially billowing smoke and airborne ash). <br/> <br/> </div>
